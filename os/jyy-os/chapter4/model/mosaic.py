### 2.1 Data structures

class Heap:
    pass  # no member: self.__dict__ is the heap

@dataclass
class Thread:
    context: Generator  # program counter, local variables, etc.
    heap: Heap  # a pointer to thread's "memory"

@dataclass
class Storage:
    persist: dict  # persisted storage state
    buf: dict  # outstanding operations yet to be persisted

### 2.2 The OperatingSystem class

class OperatingSystem:
    """An executable operating system model.

    The operating system model hosts a single Python application with a
    main() function accessible to a shared heap and 9 system calls
    (marked by the @syscall decorator). An example:

        def main():
            pid = sys_fork()
            sys_sched()  # non-deterministic context switch
            if pid == 0:
                sys_write('World')
            else:
                sys_write('Hello')

    At any moment, this model keeps tracking a set of threads and a
    "currently running" one. Each thread consists of a reference to a
    heap object (may be shared with other threads) and a private context
    (program counters, local variables, etc.). A thread context is a
    Python generator object, i.e., a stack-less coroutine [1] that can
    save the running context and yield itself.

    For applications, the keyword "yield" is reserved for system calls.
    For example, a "choose" system call [2]:

        sys_choose(['A', 'B'])

    is transpiled as yielding the string "sys_choose" followed by its
    parameters (choices):

        res = yield 'sys_choose', ['A', 'B'].

    Yield will transfer the control to the OS for system call handling
    and eventually returning a value ('A' or 'B') to the application.

    Right after transferring control to the OS by "yield", the function
    state is "frozen", where program counters and local variables are
    accessible via the generator object. Therefore, OS can serialize its
    internal state--all thread's contexts, heaps, and virtual device
    states at this moment.

    In this sense, operating system is a system-call driven state
    transition system:

        (s0) --run first thread (main)-> (s1)
             --sys_choose and application execution-> (s2)
             --sys_sched and application execution-> (s3) ...

    Real operating systems can be preemptive--context switching can
    happen non-deterministically at any program point, simply because
    processor can non-deterministically interrupt its currently running
    code and transfer the control to the operating system.

    The OS internal implementation does NOT immediately process the
    system call: it returns all possible choices available at the moment
    and their corresponding processing logic as callbacks. For the
    example above, the "choose" system call returns a non-deterministic
    choice among given choices. The internal implementation thus returns

        choices = {
            'A': (lambda: 'A'),
            'B': (lambda: 'B'),
        }

    for later processing. Another example is non-deterministic context
    switching by yielding 'sys_sched'. Suppose there are threads t1 and
    t2 at the moment. The system call handler will return

        choices = {
            't1': (lambda: switch_to(t1)),
            't2': (lambda: switch_to(t2)),
        }

    in which switch_to(th) replaces the OS's current running thread with
    th (changes the global "heap" variable). Such deferred execution of
    system calls separates the mechanism of non-deterministic choices
    from the actual decision makers (e.g., an interpreter or a model
    checker). Once the decision is made, the simply call step(choice)
    and the OS will execute this choice by

        choices[choice]()

    with the application code (generator) being resumed.

    This model provides "write" system call to immediately push data to
    a hypothetical character device like a tty associated with stdout.
    We model a block device (key-value store) that may lose data upon
    crash. The model assumes atomicity of each single block write (a
    key-value update). However, writes are merely to a volatile buffer
    which may non-deterministically lose data upon crash 3]. The "sync"
    system call persists buffered writes.

## 3. The Mosaic runtime

    The operating system model is a state transition system: os.replay()
    maps any trace to a state (with its outgoing transitions). Based
    on this model, two state space explorers are implemented:

    - run:   Choose outgoing transitions uniformly at random, yielding a
             single execution trace.
    - check: Exhaustively explore all reachable states by a breadth-
             first search. Duplicated states are not visited twice.

    Both explorers produce the visited portion of the state space as a
    serializable object containing:

    - source:   The application source code
    - vertices: A list of operating system state dumps. The first vertex
                in the list is the initial state. Each vertex has a
                unique "hashcode" id.
    - edges:    A list of 3-tuples: (source, target, label) denoting an 
                explored source --[label]-> target edge. Both source and
                target are state hashcode ids.
